## Branches

The `master` branch is currently the main development branch. Over time, when minified js becomes part of the deployment scheme, the deployment branch will
be switch to `gh-pages`. At that point, all the written code will sync with `master` and the deployable, uglified code will be pushed to `gh-pages`.
